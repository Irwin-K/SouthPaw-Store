      <p class="default">Our SwitchItUp crew figured out that there was a problem in the classroom and workforce community: left-handed people are left out. Our solution to this epidemic is our 3D printed product, SwitchItUp Scissors.
<br><br><br>
We propose these universal, left AND right handed, scissors to replace old fashioned paper sheers. Over 10% of the worlds population is left handed, equating to over 760 million people who avoid using scissors or are forced to learn how to learn to cut with their right hands. In a way, a lack of opportunity has been created for left handed people, for they have been living in a right handed dominant world.
<br><br><br>
Our goal is to create a product that suits left handed people and works universally at the same time, not leaving anyone out like left handed people have been for years. We hope to penetrate the classroom and workforce market, so that when the time comes for more scissors, people see the importance in buying ones that suit everyone's needs, that includes everyone!</p>
